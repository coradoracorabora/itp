#FizzBuzz!!!
##pseudocode
I know I'll need to have some kind of loop with numbers counting upwards by one

and i think working an if two `if else` statements 

and have one of them be an `else if` so that I can use a few different conditions

i wonder if i can do this all in one function? is that the easiest way to do this?

what was that one function that had a `%` the divisible one? i feel like its necessary (found it, it was line 71)
##writing down the lines  in the codealong.js that i think will be important
51 - while-else loop

61 - for loop

78 - nested for-loop

103 - recursion with a stop condition

28 - multiple conditions

71 - divisible by

44 - while loop (counting)

i think thats everything?

also remember the `$`
##trying it for real
###step 1: counting
starting with recursion with a stop condition seems important, i need 1-100

mmmmmmmmm i tried to use line 103 and edit that function but i think i should just use the version on line 44 cause 103 was a little overcomplicated

okay the version with line 44 worked better and it counts from 1 to 100 now

yay!

i guess im not using anything that involves recursion yet, just a while loop, maybe i'll need a recursive function soon?
###step 2: how the fuck do i have it check for divisibility
i hope divisibility is a word

do i need to be checking if a number is divisible by 3 or 5 before the `count++`? or can i just do it after, later in the while loop or in a different function altogether?

I think in the middle of the function is necessary, time for nesting!
