# Okay hell yes let's get started

###pseudo code
I feel like the instructions are pretty straightforward? like i dont know how much room for error there is
**but!** I would like to see if there's a way for me to do the conversion both ways?
like I don't know if that would mean a second file or if there would be a way for me to use the same variables, or if I would need to have like a **c2** to keep the formulas from interfering with each other

###work time
im trying the double
im gonna use xIn and xOut for the two variables, I just gotta figure out the inverse of the equation that was provided

`c = (f - 32) 5/9
9/5 (c) = f - 32
(9/5 * c) + 32 = f`

I think? im gonna google it to double check
it was right

now im realizing that there are decisions to make
i tried to make `fIn & Out` and `cIn & Out` and use the `console.log()` to display the `fOut` and i think `console.log(fOut)`
