##Chapter 1
I think I knew that there was a difference between formal and natural languages, and have thought about the differences before, mostly in relation to music theory

I did not know, or had not heard someone say, that people respond to computers as if they were people. The example of viewing them as an employee really helped me understand that, and what can be helpful when running into a bug or difficulty.
##Chapter 3
I knew that an empty parentheses after a function meant that it didn't need an argument. Well, not with those words exactly but I knew thing with empty parenthesis worked on its own.

I hadn't thought about stack diagrams before! The visual helps a lot when trying to think about something that would require multiple steps to pull off.
##Chapter 5
I knew the modulus operator! We used that one! I think in the FizzBuzz thing but maybe a different time.

I didn't know about the `input()` function, but a lot of the rest of this chapter was things we have addressed in class. I can't remember if all the concepts were in python but its mostly the same syntax as what we did I think.
##Chapter 10
I knew that you could specify printing or changing parts of a list by specifying the index (starting at 0).

I didn't know (or didn't think) that you could use functions to change lists, like functions that execute themselves as part of a larger scheme. I do have a hard time envisioning when I would need to do something beyong simple one step functions, but I think that's because I don't have experience with it yet.

I honestly don't get the section on traversing a list, but I think I have a grip on most of the other stuff, even if I don't have the specific function names memorized.
