## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

**Ooh! Shaders!(and more!)**

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

My project will be a web-based visual generator based on GLSL (i think i can pull that off?). Kind of similar to the Hydra interface but with less exposed code I think and more keyboard controls (thanks for the recommendation).

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

*Hydra (for reference)* - `https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?code=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`

*GLSL reference and intro to shaders* - `thebookofshaders.com`

*my friend Emory who made a midi controller glove* - I'm just gonna ask him how he was thinking about it and I think that will help

*youtube videos that explain some introductory stuff about GLSL* - i really don't know what im doing with GLSL, I've done some basic basic follow tutorial stuff because it's better for quick processing in TouchDesigner (and mac's in general) but really this is the first real thing im doing with it `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtrzuSFfsSo&list=PLo4jZiz27cjmCT1BRg7dZXIxroAbkz-eU` `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opbZOCFazSE`

*slime mold P5.js tutorial* *i found it on the front page of p5js.org and i've seen people do the same thing with touchdesigner stuff and glsl and i think this is a good place to start in terms of making sure something is moving and looks cool on the website* `https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2213463/#code`

*wtf is P5.js really and how do i use it*
`https://p5js.org/tutorials/creating-styling-html/` - who knew that p5js.org would be helpful?

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will be a simple, web-based, keyboard-controlled interface  that can be used for generating some (probably) abstract visuals. Like hydra but no exposed code and just simple little keyboard buttons. Maybe even a pdf that's linked with the controls. I really like the start screen that explains what's going on when you open the hydra page and I think that could be useful for what I'm doing, but maybe having a way to put an extension into the url so you can skip past the startup page and just get going?

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

Not really, this is stuff i'm interested in using but no classes are involved that would benefit from this project

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Something in a browser that moves that has some basic input controls through the keyboard.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

^ the same thing PLUS multiple "modes" of making visuals on the spot. I think just being able to choose one at the beginning and needing to reload the page and start over to get a different one is reasonable for this

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

^ same thing, but easily switching between the different modes, being able to use a new mode to interact with a mode that was already there. Fullscreen capability. Something that I can use at a show, just pull up and open my browser and bam! something cool on the projector

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

*steps to accomplish:*

- 1 set up the basic layout of the website, learn what P5.js even is, get more familiar with the HTML structures of a website

- 2 get a grip on some basic GLSL/P5 concepts, implement them either in touchdesigner (probably easier to start with since I know the interface) or the editor.p5js.org

- 3 try to implement at least one system for generating some basic kind of visual thing, maybe something text based that gets warped, or just some basic manipulation of shapes and lines. This is the step where I figure out how to control it with keyboard inputs

- 4 set up multiple modes of creating/manipulating the visuals, figure out if i can integrate the two approaches and implement functionality of switching: this could be selecting from a menu like in the last reference I have listed above, or having some kind of key in the corner to tell you how to switch between the different modes (who knows? maybe even multiple modes from each approach?)

*what do I need to learn?*

put something that looks cool on a website? I still don't totally get the whole like, linking a p5 file to the html, plus like, how does css fit into this? maybe that's gonna be super crucial and something i need to spend a lot of time learning to pull this off

I gotta learn a lot about GLSL or just browser based visual generation in general. I think this will end up kind of like a math project, i'll need to do a lot of math i think

^same thing but with p5.js ...  like, i'm not even sure if i can use the two at the same time? i dont even really know what that means or what it would look like?
