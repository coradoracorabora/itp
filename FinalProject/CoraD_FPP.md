## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

My project will be a web-based visual generator based on GLSL (i think i can pull that off?). Kind of similar to the Hydra interface but with less exposed code I think and more keyboard controls (thanks for the recommendation).

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

*my friend Emory who made a midi controller glove* - I'm just gonna ask him how he was thinking about it and I think that will help

*youtube videos that explain some introductory stuff about GLSL* - i really don't know what im doing with GLSL, I've done some basic basic follow tutorial stuff because it's better for quick processing in TouchDesigner (and mac's in general) but really this is the first real thing im doing with it `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtrzuSFfsSo&list=PLo4jZiz27cjmCT1BRg7dZXIxroAbkz-eU` `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opbZOCFazSE`

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will be a simple, web-based, keyboard-controlled interface  that can be used for generating some (probably) abstract visuals

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

Not really, this is stuff i'm interested in using but no classes are involved that would benefit from this project

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

*steps to accomplish:*

- 1 set up the basic layout of the website, learn what P5.js even is, get more familiar with the HTML structures of a website

- 2 get a grip on some basic GLSL concepts, implement them either in touchdesigner (probably easier to start with since I know the interface) or directly on a website to start

- 3 try to implement at least one system for generating some basic kind of visual thing, maybe something text based that gets warped, or just some basic manipulation of shapes and lines. This is the step where I figure out how to control it with keyboard inputs

- 4 set up multiple modes of manipulating the visuals and implement functionality of switching: this could be selecting from a menu like in the last reference I have listed above, or having some kind of key in the corner to tell you how to switch between the different modes

*what do I need to learn?*

I gotta learn a lot about GLSL or just browser based visual generation in general. I think this will end up kind of like a math project, i'll need to do a lot of math i think

I'm still kind of confused on the whole setup of a website in general, especially something involving P5.js - still not totally sure what P5.js is
